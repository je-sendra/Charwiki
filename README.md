# Charwiki

Loomian Legacy PvP companion.

## Features 🚀

Charwiki is a companion app for the Roblox game Loomian Legacy. It is designed to help players in the competitive scene by providing tools to help them build their teams and analyze their opponents.

### Sets Loomipedia 📚

The Sets Loomipedia is a list of sets for each Loomian. It will contain the most common sets for each Loomian, as well as some niche sets that can be used in specific situations.

Charwiki's Sets Loomipedia not only provides the traditional set information (moves, items, EVs, etc.), but also provides a brief description of the set and some tips on how to use it effectively, as well as useful metadata such as the version of the game the set was created for.

You will also be able to create your own sets and share them with the community!

### Damage Calc 🧮

The Damage Calc is a tool that allows you to calculate the damage that a move will do to a Loomian. It will take into account the attacker's stats, the defender's stats, the move's base power, the move's type, and any other relevant factors.

Charwiki's Damage Calc Integration will also allow you to export and import sets from the Sets Loomipedia, so you can quickly calculate the damage that a specific set will do to a specific Loomian.

### Match Sheet 📊

The Match Sheet is a datasheet that will help you keep track of what you know about your opponent's Loomians and moves. It will allow you to record information such as the Loomian's moveset, the Loomian's stats, and any other relevant information.

### Teambuilder 🛠️

The Teambuilder is a tool that will help you build your team. It will allow you to create teams, add Loomians to your team, and analyze your team's weaknesses. It will also provide you with suggestions on how to improve your team.

It will also have an AI tool that will help you analyze your team's weaknesses and suggest ways to improve your team (very experimental idea, may fail often).

## Access 🌐
