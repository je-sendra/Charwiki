# Charwiki

Loomian Legacy smogon-like project.

## Features

Planned features for Charwiki include:

- [ ] **Sets Loomipedia**: Will have a list of sets for each Loomian.
- [ ] **Damage Calc integration**: Will have a "Damage Calc" tab, with the possibility to export/import sets from the Sets Loomipedia.
- [ ] **Match Sheet**: Will act as a datasheet for what you know about opposing Loomians and moves.
- [ ] **Teambuilder**: Will be able to create teams and use AI tools to examine weaknesses (very experimental idea, may fail often).
