# Branch naming guidelines

When creating a new branch, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Use lowercase letters**: Branch names should be in lowercase to maintain consistency.
2. **Use hyphens for spaces**: Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in branch names.
3. **Use the following format**: `<user>/<description>`. For example, `je-sendra/do-something`.
4. **When in doubt, ask**: If you're unsure about a branch name, ask a project maintainer for guidance.
5. **When related to an issue**: If the branch is directly related to an issue, you can use the issue number as the branch name. For example, `je-sendra/issue123`. Branches that are related to issues should be linked to the issue in the pull request description and only include changes strictly related to that issue.
