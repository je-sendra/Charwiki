# Testing Guidelines

## General Principles

- Write clear and concise test cases.
- Follow the existing testing style and conventions used in the project.
- Include comments and documentation where necessary.
- Ensure test cases are independent, isolated, and repeatable.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- Test individual components, functions, or methods in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies to ensure tests are independent and repeatable.

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components, modules, or services.
- Ensure that integrated components work together as expected.
- Use real or simulated external dependencies to test interactions.

### End-to-End Tests

- Test the entire application or system from end to end.
- Verify that all components work together as expected.
- Use real or simulated user interactions to test the system.
- Ensure tests cover common use cases and edge cases.
